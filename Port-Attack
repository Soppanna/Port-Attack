-> To disable recursion on the DNS server using the Windows interface
-> Open DNS Manager.
-> In the console tree, right-click the applicable DNS server, then click Properties.
->DNS/applicable DNS server
->Click the Advanced tab.
In Server options, select the Disable recursion check box, and then click OK.
 
For Plesk:
 
1) Log in to your Plesk Panel as admin.
2) On the left menu, select "Server Management > Tools & Settings" section (previously called "Server").
3) In the main panel, select "DNS Template Settings" (previously called "DNS Settings".
4) Select the DNS Recursion Tab.
5) Select the Deny option and click the Set button to complete the operation.
 
For Linux :
 
Edit the file /etc/named.conf and change the below variables in the "options{" section to secure your DNS service:
 
 
    allow-transfer {none;};
    allow-recursion {none;};
    allow-query-cache {none;}; // for BIND 9.4+
    recursion no;
    additional-from-cache no;
 
Once these modifications are complete, you must  restart the DNS service.
 
II) Open SNMP service used for an attack
 
Please consider reconfiguring your SNMP system in one or more of these ways:
-> Block queries made by unauthorized addresses. This can be done with an ACL or other firewall rule.
-> Use a different query string than "public" and which cannot be easily guessed by a 3rd party.
-> Disable SNMP entirely
